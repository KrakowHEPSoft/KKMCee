Highlights of the baseline version 4.14 of KK Monte Carlo of 30 June 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physics:
  Coherent Eclusive EXponentiation CEEX
  -- exponentiation at the level of spin amplitudes.
  Second order CEEX matr. ele. in is now implemented for the first time!
  Many internal tests show generic theoretical precision 0.2% in x-sections and A_FB.
  According to LEP2 MC workshop tests 0.2 agreement with Zfitter is found.

  ISR*FSR interference is now included, CEEX is mandatory for this.
  Note that in the default input configuration the FSR from quarks is now ON.

  Transverse and longitudinal spin correlations of tau (CEEX mandatory).

  Longitudinal and transverse polarization of beams possible, 
  but special arangement of input data required (CEEX mandatory).

  Generation of final state fermion-pair flavour event-per-event
  including consistently ISR+FSR QED radiation.

  Quark showering and hadronization using Jetset.

  Very much improved EEX (old) type exponentiated matrix element, BHLUMI style;
  more stable numericaly, no negative weights, no large weights,
  added O(alf^3L^3) contribution in ISR and FSR matrix element,
  also for quarks (but physics of the QED FSR from quarks is shaky!!!)
  also faster, no "reduction procedure" any more!

  Electroweak and QCD corrections are from Dizet6.x (as in KORALZ)

  For FSR: finite mass effects at the crude level,
  including option of photon removal below E_min in CMS frame,
  final state particles may have different mass and arbitrary charge.

  Beamstrahlung with realistic spectra from CIRCE/GuineaPig packages.
  
  Recently added possibility of m+mu- and q-qbar beams insetad of e+e-
  Q-qbar beams with collinear PDFs in some rudimentary form are there.

Programming:
  Output in /hepevt/ and /lujets/ formats.
  Almost entire code is organized in pseudo-classes, see appendix A below.
  No hidden input in source code, ALL input data in the disk files.
  The default input data are stored in /KK-all/KK2ff.defaults file.

  The reader may read its own input using ReaDataX(lun,xpar,imax)
  in the initialization process -- the defaults will be overwritten.

  Tables of Electroweak corrections are created and stored in directory
  DIZET, this is done once for ever for given Higgs and Top mass.
  Present pretabulation up to 1020GeV

  Partial OOP is implementer, see POOPrules file for details.

Limitations:
  Neutrino channel not well tested,
  Incomplete second order for FSR CEEX.
