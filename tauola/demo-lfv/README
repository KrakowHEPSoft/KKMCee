Demo of tauola-BBB with the new LFV channel added to the list of decay
channels and generation set to use only this channel.

NOTE:
This example is based on demo-babar with only small differences:
- New channel named "Dalitz for Tau->3mu LFV" is defined in file lfv.c
  and registered in iniofc.c as channel 92.
- Two lines are added to taumain.f:
    CALL TauolaRedef
    CALL INIofC
- In prod/dane.dat channel 92 is used in generation.

OTHER NOTES:
In iniofc.c the number given to the new channel is 90 but its actual number
is 92. This shift is needed to account for two leptonic channels.

The new channel's branching ratio is set to 0. As such, if in 'prod/dane.dat'
JAK1 and JAK2 are set to 0, this example will produce results identical to
demo-babar.
