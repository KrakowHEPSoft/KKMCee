Matrix element type me as used in  RegisterChannel method of channels_wrappers.h
           0- channel not initialized,  1- constant ME flat phase space
           2- default ME,               3- default ME, but one stable spin>0
           4- default ME wrapped curr., 5- wrapped ME  


List of channels that have different order of entries in event record than
arguments of methods for matix-element/current calculations:

      NM4 group (DAM4PI), wrapper for channel 1: 

            event record  : pi- pi- pi+ pi0
            matrix element: pi- pi- pi0 pi+
            current       : pi- pi- pi0 pi+

            If Novosibirsk currents are used  1,4,2,3
            but this is of no practical importance for wrap

      NM4 group (DAM4PI), wrapper for channel 2:

            event record  : pi0 pi0 pi0 pi- 
            matrix element: pi0 pi0 pi0 pi- 
            current       : pi0 pi0 pi0 pi- 

            If Novosibirsk currents are used 4, 3, 1, 2 
            but this is of no practical importance for wrap
