VALIDATED:
  SVN REVISION: 1852
  DATE:         11.08.2014

1) Parameters of PHOTOS were not fine tuned. For the run
   of Generator 1 minimal photon energy was slightly smaller.
2) Parameters for minimum photon energy in leptonic tau decays
   was not fixed to the same value as well.
3) Changes described in file 'tauola-bbb-rev1852.patch' have been
   introduced to match BaBar setup.

APPLYING PATCH FILE:
--------------------
To apply the above patch file one has to export the 1852 revision of
TAUOLA-FORTRAN, copy teh patch file to TAUOLA-FORTRAN/tauola-bbb directory
and execute from this directory line:
      
  patch -p0 -i tauola-bbb-rev1852.patch

An additional patch file 'tauola-bbb-rev2110.patch' has been provided which
contains exactly the same changes as patch file for revision 1852 but
has been updated to the revision 2110. Changes are cosmetic. For example,
instead of 'demo-standalone/taumain.f' file 'demo-babar/taumain.f' is patched.
This patch should work with all newer version of the distribution.

MC-TESTER:
----------
Changes applied by these patch files require adding MC-TESTER libraries 
at the linking step. As this strongly depends on user environment,
we have not added corresponding lines to the patch files.
Please note: in order to make the MC-TESTER work the same HEPEVT library
has to be used in MC-TESTER installation and in user framework.

As an example, to add MC-TESTER to our demo examples one would have to
modify makefile line 26 - line that starts with $(LD).
One would have to adding to the end of this line following flags:

  $(shell root-config --glibs) -L$(MCTESTERLOCATION)/lib -lHEPEvent -lMCTester -Wl,--rpath,$(MCTESTERLOCATION)/lib

This assumes environmental variable $MCTESTERLOCATION is set, and 'root-config'
is available from command line.

See MC-TESTER documentation on how to compare two MC-TESTER output files
to produce the pdf.
