Tune of tauola-BBB to BaBar.
Introduced ability to add user currents or modify existing currents.

Several examples have been provided:

1) demo-redefine   - example of adding new currents.
2) demo-babar      - example of default BaBar setup.
3) demo-lfv        - example of adding and using LFV current.

4) patch-tauolapp   - README and files for adding tauola-bbb to tauolapp.
5) patch-KK-face    - README and files for adding tauola-bbb to KKMC.
6) patch-babar-validation - README and files needed to reproduce our validation of BaBar initialization.

By default 'makefile' located in this directory adds objects from 'tauola-c'
directory to the library. This introduces ability to add user currents or
modify existing currents. This feature can be turned off by removing
'tauola-c' objects and adding dummy functions provided in 'tauola-no-c'.
This will also remove dependency on C++.

STARTING POINT for bbb work (SVN version 1136).
Tune of  tauola-BBB to CLEO (Oct.2005)
List of changes, controlled by parameter IFCLEO:

0) demo-standalone/taumain.f - Default: IFCLEO=.true. For IFCLEO=.FALSE.
	                       GAMPRT matrix is redefined and prototype
	                       channels are turned on, following tauola-BBB.
1) pi- pi0 K0          - cross-contaminated by xxxx5xxxxxx (and so on) channels
                         Switching them off (IFCLEO=.true.) makes
                         these channel match for mc-tester.
2) K-  K0  pi0         - TAUOLA CLEO of Oct.2005) has low NTRIALS
                         Has to be changed to 45000 as in tauola-BBB
                         for these channels to match.
3) pi- pi- pi+ pi0 pi0 - channel 30 matches CLEO. Switch off ch. 31 & 33
4) pi- pi- pi- pi+ pi+ - channel 51 matches CLEO. Switch off ch. 35
			 Quality/purpose of
                         non-cleo channels: 31, 33, 35 is forgotten.
                         The IFCLEO=.true. switches them off.
