Demo of tauola-BBB presenting channel adding and redefinition

NOTE:
This example is based on demo-babar with only small differences:
- Several .c and .h files are added presenting the new functionality.
- Only two lines are added to taumain.f:
    CALL TauolaRedef
    CALL INIofC

Aug 30 2014 new functionality is now added number of channels is increased to nearly 200.
########### All initialization is done with the help of information stored in common blocs.
            As a default initialization used by BaBar collaboration for basic background studies is introduced.
            For 2pi, 3pi, 4pi and 5pi modes an alternative, usually of better or at least distinct theoretical
            basis and of some better or worse fits to the experimental data, matrix elements can be used.
            Substantial number of new modes including anomalous ones (in particular tau-neutrinoless ones are prepared).

            The common block storage of channel information, enables re-initialization from the side of C++.
            It can be used, in particular, to implement new channels with new currents/MatrixElements.
            This new interface to C++ is quite independent from the FORTRAN rest of the program. 
            It can be detached and dummy routines need to be added instead, to fulfil linker
            (these routines will be then never be invoked). Also, its structure can be easily modified, 
            without affecting the rest of the project. 
   
            Instructions on how to install/use this new version into Tauolapp and KKMC are provided. 
            For more details see appropriate READMEs in: `patch-KK-face` `patch-tauolapp` and an interface for C++ 
            re-initialization `tauola-c` READMEs there.  See also comments in iniofc.c file.

            We describe  a prototype solution, we do not know whether it will meet need of experiments and other
            individual physict. We must collect feed backs to which we are looking for.




Oct 09 2004  That was the starting work on version of Tauola which was later used by BaBar collaboration
###########  Over the time these explanation became outdated.

1)
  There were 40+20 empty new slots (and one filled in) prepared for tauola running.
  At present they are initialized with some dummy stuff, which make them running
  but into unphysical configurations only.
2) Nonetheless  the defaults for KKMC governing tau decays are not changed, re-mapping is done at tauola 
   initialization. Tauface.f file of KKMC need change of course
3) All phase space masses and flavours can be initialized in routine INITDK as always.
   The matrices IDFFIN(9,NMODE),MULPIK(NMODE) are appropriately extended for that, this applies to all chanels
   presented below.

4) The new slot is for tau decay to pi-pi0pi0  is at the position 72 it has the same current as for channel 
   5 but it can be now indepenently recoded, thus can have  different current than for channel 5 (pi+pi-pi-).
   It is defined now for mnum=9 as defined in functions form1-form5, overall coeficients for the 
   contributions to the current are defined (again for mnum=9) in routine  F3PI. The overall coeficients
   are  defined in routine  DAMPPK wit the help of usual coefficients FNORM(0:19),COEF(1:5,0:19);
   values at FNORM(9) and at COEF(1:5,9);
5) extra 10 channels for 3 scalars  are prepared, they can be initialized using the same formfactors and coefficients
   as in case of pi-pi0pi0, but for positions mnum=10 to 19. Dummy initializations for these channels is giving
   now  charged non conserving final state pi0pi0pi0, they corrrspond to positions 53 to 62 for branching ratios
6) extra 10 channels for n pions (it does not need to be 6!) are initialized at positions 54 to 63 of branching ratios
   the appropriate inclusive spectra for dGamma/d(Q**2) are to be filled in in routine sigee(Q2,JNP)
   for JNP from 7 to 16, the line in routine sigee:
        IF(JNPI.GT.6) JNPI=6  ! warning
   has to be replaced.  these channels write into hepevt 3pi-3pi+ or 2pi-2pi+2pi0.
7) extra 20 channels for 4 scalars in list of branching ratios are at positions 10 to 29 of branching ratios
   Their current ha to be provied in routine CURR_CLEO(MNUM,PIM1,PIM2,PIM3,PIM4,HADCUR), for mnum=3  to 22,
   at present dumily mnum=2 for every of this cases, thus the current for pi-pi0pi0pi0p, the phase space factor 
   1/6 has to be checked, if activated these channels put 3 pions and one Kaon into  the event record. 
8) extra 20 channels for 5 scalars in list of branching ratios they are at positions 31 to 50 of branching ratios
   the current  CURR5 can be used for that purpose, for the consecutive slots 31 to 50 dam5pi get the index
   from 24 to 43. If activated these channels write into HEPEVT decays into one Kaon and 4 pions.
9) Note that for 5pi channel 30 crappy matrix element is used as in old tauola.  From routine  DPH5PI
   condition
       if (jnpi.gt.13) !
     $ CALL DAM5PI(
   should be removed and current CURR5 should be used and initialized for  jnpi=23 exactly as in point 8)
9) extra 10 channels for 2 scalars in list of branching ratios they are at positions 84 to 93 of branching ratios
   current has to be adjusted in  DPHSRK parameter inum can be used to distinguish, but it is not done so far.
   non-standard dcays like mu+mu+mu- are to be placed there (?), but some work on neutrino flavour in storing 
   and in mass setting has to be done still. If activated these events write in HEPEVT tau decays into K-K-
