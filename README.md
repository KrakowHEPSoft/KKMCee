# The KKMCee 5 Monte Carlo Generator version in C++ 
### [The main authors: S. Jadach, B. F. L. Ward, Z. Was, S. A. Yost and A. Siodmok] 

KKMCee 5 is a multi-photon Monte Carlo event generator KKMCee for lepton and quark pair production in lepton colliders.

This is a web page of KKMCee 5 Monte Carlo event generator [1] for lepton and quark pair production for the high energy electron-positron annihilation process. 
It is still the most sophisticated event generator for such processes. Its entire source code is rewritten in the modern C++ language. 
It reproduces all features of the older KKMCee code in Fortran 77 [2]. However, a number of improvements in the Monte Carlo algorithm are also implemented. Most importantly, 
it is intended to be a starting point for future improvements (for example described in [2303.14260](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14260.pdf)), 
which will be mandatory for future high-precision lepton collider projects.
