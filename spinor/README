Notes for today: 18 Nov 1998.
=============================
All tests have output dumped onto benchmark disk-file.
The actual output is automaticaly diff'ed with respect to benchark.
For the moment there are 11 tests:
*//   make Test_SfacISR
*//   make Test_SfacFSR
*//   make Test_Rmat        <--- output in TH preprint!!!
*//   make Test_UV
*//   make Test_BornXsec
*//   make Test_IsrSingle
*//   make Test_FsrSingle
*//   make Test_NewSingle   <--- new!!!
*//   make Test_MultiPhot
*//   make Test_Virtual
*//   make Test_Rules
*//   make Test_DsigOverDtau

The most recent is test of Zbyszek: Test_NewSingle
I hope it still works properly.

The most important is Test_Rmat, its output is in TH preprint!!!

Note that the first new test on tau transverse correlations is
in subdirectory ffbench.

Staus report for today, 4 may 1998.
===================================

Born
====
Born spina amplitudes are based on Chisholm identity, i.e. electron mass
is set exacly to zero. Final fermion mass is kept finite.
Unpolarized differential cross section is tested 2-fold.
If Z is off then 12-digit agreement is found from threshold to infinity.
For Z on, the rasonable agreement is found far from the threshold.
Double spin correlation matrix element R of KORALB for final taus
is reproduced in the case of Z swiched off, from threshold to infinity.
This is highly nontrivial test because spin quantization axes for
present KS/GPS method are different from KORALB choice.
The appropriate nontrivial rotation in the rest frame of each tau is done 
before agreement in R is obtained.
Tralor routine for GPS scheme is constructed.
To be done:
- The test of R has to be done once again with original Tralor
  and spin amplitudes of KORALB (I have done short-cuts)
- For Z on, some test has to be done, spin correlations are trivial
  but signs of polarization vectors has to be checked.

1-photon ISR
============
For ISR single photon spin amplitudes using KS (Kleiss&Stirling)
method are written in such a way that soft and non-infrared parts
are clearly separated.
The calculation exists in 2 versions (like in KS papers) with auxiliary
axial gauge vector b defining photon polarization being identical
to k0=xi and not identical. In the second case we have possibility
of additional x-checks of gauge invariance 
(KeyArb=0,1 switches between the two methods).
The agreemen with 3 other subprograms is found:
with (1) old clasical formula used in YFS3, (2) program of Ela based
on MULTI subroutine, which is mathematicaly equivalent to KS and ours
(modulo phase controll) (3) spinor formula of Kleiss programmed by Ela.
The agreement was also found at angles comparable to m_e/Wbeam,
i.e. so called mass corrections are also reproduced.
The agreement holds for Z switched on.
Note that in the above tests fermion mass (electron) was always small.
To be done:
- compare R correlation matrix derived
  from new spin amplitudes and these of KORALB, down to tau threshold!
- bug was found in YFS3ff matrix element, partly corrected...

1-photon FSR
============
Here, single photon spin amplitudes using KS/GPS are also written
and partly tested.
The agreement of unpolarized differential differential distributions
with old standard YFS3 formula is found for Z on and off.
The agreement with KS and Kleiss, as programmed by Ela is found for
Z being off, but some problem persists for Z on (under investigation).
For Z-off at high energies there is perfect agreement with MULTI approach
however close to tau threshold there is 20% difference which should
not be there, as both calculations in principle treat tau mass rigorously.
Most probably this is due to neglecting tau mass in some trivial
normalization factors.
To be done:
- for unpolarised distributions, to debug mass terms close to tau threshold
- find out the reason for disagreement in Z-on case.
- compare R correlation matrix derived
  from new spin amplitudes and these of KORALB, down to tau threshold!
