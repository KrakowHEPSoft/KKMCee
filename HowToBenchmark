This is detailed instruction how to reproduce basic benchmark,
the same as in Phys. Rev. D63 (2000) Table III,
that is table of total cross sections and charge asymmetries
executing run in MaMar/workKKMC and producing latex/pdf files
in MaMar/Plots using TabBenchPRD.cxx program.
File to be reproduced is TableIII_PRD88_NewDiz.pdf.
The best is to run on the farm, as it takes at least 24h
on single processor of laptop to get at least 50M events.
================================================================
  git clone git@github.com:KrakowHEPSoft/KKMCee-dev.git
  mv KKMCee-dev KKMCee-dev-master
  cd KKMCee-dev-master

  ln -s dizet-6.45 dizet
  autoreconf -i --force
  ./configure
  make
  
  cd MaMar/workKKMC
  cp workKKMC_189GeV.input workKKMC.input
  make start
  make stop
  
  make SLfarm96
  make SLsubmitall
  make q-nev
  make combine
  (cd ../Plots; make TableIII-pdf)
================================================================
last command will probably fail because latex may be not available
in the system of the farm. I such a case import workKKMC/histo.root
file on you laptop and run:
  cd MaMar/Plots/
  make TableIII-pdf
The resulting table should agree with the table in
  MaMar/Plots/TableIII_PRD88_NewDiz.pdf
provided statistics is at least 50M events.
The same workKKMC/histo.root is of course produced with "make start"
on laptop, but statistics will be low, unless you run 24h.

In case you want to reproduce original benchmark of PRD63 paper
with old Dizet 6.21 then do the following:
  ln -s dizet-6.21 dizet
  cp .KK2f_defaults-2000 .KK2f_defaults
and rebuild/recompile the project.
================================================================
