Present version is customized as a starting point 
for the KKMChh developmnet branch for Drell-Yan process.

Production chain (C) was used to crosscheck Fig.1 in paper
https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04035

Simplified PDFs of u and d quarks are introduced
directly in the bornv/BornV.f source code.

Only ProdFSR production chain is active and will be preserved

Main program level (histogrammin, plotting) written in C++, 
using interface to f77 level through standard wrappers.

Make system is organized using autotolls.
Custom KK-makefile system still kept, sometime works better.
IMPORTANT: present version works with ROOT version 5!

The following instruction are mostly OBSOLETE,
appart of desription of chain (C).

*********************************************************
Building program (autotools) from the distribution tarfile:
  tar -xvzf KKMC_v4_22m.tgz
  cd KKMC_v4_22m
  ./configure
  make
in case of problems one may also need to do:
  autoreconf -i --force

Presently there are THREE chains of the user-level analysis programs:
************************ (A) ************************
The original chain (2002) for muon AFB analysis consists of:
-- main program                ./Test.cxx
-- histogramming               ./ROBOL.cxx
-- wrappers to f77             ./KKMC.cxx
-- work direct. (input/output) ./test0
-- post-generation analysis    ./Plots/Plot1.cxx ./Plots/PlotAFB.cxx
Presently used to examine QED effects
in AFB close to Z resonance (init-fin. interf.).
Running instructions:
     cp test0/test0_95GeV.input test0/test0.input
     make test0-start
     make test0-stop
     make Plot1
     make PlotAFB
     make workAFB-start
     make PlotAFB2
     
************************ (B) ************************
Analysis chain introduced in febr. 2014, (febr 2015), 
for ee->nu+nu+gamma process (invisible Z width at FCCee):
-- main program                ./ProdZinv.cxx
-- histogramming               ./ROBOL2.cxx
-- work directory              ./workZinv
-- post-generation analysis    ./Plots/Plot2.cxx
Running instructions:
   cp workZinv/workZinv.input_E161GeV workZinv/workZinv.input
   make workZinv-start
   make workZinv-stop
   make Plot2
   
************************ (C) ************************
!!!! Obsolete in KKMCee branch !!!!!
Analysis chain as in Jan. 2016 to examine effects 
of switching on/off QED FSR in p p -> l+ l- (with PDFs).
Overall normalization debuged using ./Plots/PlotFSR.cxx

-- main program                ./ProdFSR.cxx
-- histogramming               ./ROBOFSR.cxx
-- work directory              ./workFSR
-- post-generation analysis    ./Plots/PlotFSR.cxx
Running instructions:
   cp workFSR/workFSR.input_E125GeV workFSR/workFSR.input
   make workFSR-start
   make workFSR-stop
   make PlotFSR
 
*****************************************************************
 --- To be done
 1. automake ignores source change in *.h files in the fortran code
