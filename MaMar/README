This directory was originally for studies of the
mu-pair production process at BaBar experiment (2002).

Similarly as in RHadr subrojest, main program level (histogrammin, plotting)
written in C++, interface to fortran level through standar wrappers.

Make system is organized using autotolls.

This original setup includes main program ./Test.cxx,
histogramming in ROBOL.cxx, wrappers in KKMC.cxx,
work directory ./test0 and Plots/Plot1.cxx for plotting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Presently (febr. 2014), production chain for nu+nu+gamma 
channel is added with:
- main program Main2.cxx
- histogramming in ROBOL2.cxx
- work directory ./test2 and 
- Plots/Plot2.cxx for plotting
