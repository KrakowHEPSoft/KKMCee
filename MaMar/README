This directory was originally developed for studies of the
mu-pair production process at BaBar experiment (2002).

Main program level (histogrammin, plotting) written in C++, 
using interface to f77 level through standard wrappers.

Make system is organized using autotolls.
Custom KK-makefile system still kept, sometime works better.
IMPORTANT: present version works with ROOT version 5!

Building program (autotools) from the distribution tarfile:
  tar -xvzf KKMC_v4_22m.tgz
  cd KKMC_v4_22m
  ./configure
  make
in case of problems one may also need to do:
  autoreconf -i --force

Presently there are THREE chains of the user-level analysis programs:
************************ (A) ************************
The original chain (2002) for muon AFB analysis consists of:
-- main program                ./Test.cxx
-- histogramming               ./ROBOL.cxx
-- wrappers to f77             ./KKMC.cxx
-- work direct. (input/output) ./test0
-- post-generation analysis    ./Plots/Plot1.cxx
Presently used to examine QED effects
in AFB close to Z resonance (init-fin. interf.).
Running instructions:
     cp test0/test0_95GeV.input test0/test0.input
     make test0-start
     make test0-stop
     make Plot1
     
************************ (B) **********************************
Analysis chain of febr. 2014, (febr 2015), 
for ee->nu+nu+gamma process (invisible Z width), Paris 2014,
http://nz42.ifj.edu.pl/_media/user/jadach/main/talks/fcceeparis14.pdf
-- main program                ./ProdZinv.cxx
-- histogramming               ./ROBOL2.cxx
-- work directory              ./workZinv
-- post-generation analysis    ./Plots/Plot2.cxx
Running instructions:
   cp workZinv/workZinv.input_E161GeV workZinv/workZinv.input
   make workZinv-start
   make workZinv-stop
   make Plot2
   
 ************************ (C) **********************************
 First analysis of the IFI contribution to AFB near Z
 in ee->mumu process, presented at FCC Week 2016, Rome,
 http://nz42.ifj.edu.pl/_media/user/jadach/main/talks/2016-rome-fccweek.pdf
-- KKMC run  with main Prod0.cxx and
   KKMC.cxx PartLund.cxx ROBOL.cxx Semaph.cxx
-- work directory: ./workAFB  
-- analysis progs: ./Plots/Plot1 ./Plots/PlotAFB  ./Plots/PlotAFB2
                    and more recent ./Plots/PlotIFI.cxx
   
 ************************ (D1) **********************************
 New analysis "in progress" of the IFI contribution to AFB near Z
 in ee->mumu process, started april 2017 using FOAM
 Obsolete (!!!) branch to be kept for some time:
 -- FOAM based MC, main prog.:  ProdFoam.cxx 
    and KKMC.cxx KKfoam.cxx  RoboFoam.cxx Semaph.cxx
 -- work directory: ./workFOAM
 -- analysis: ./Plots/PlotFoam1.cxx, exploiting results of (C)
 ************************ (D2) **********************************
 Better new version, with possibility of runing on the farm:
 -- FOAM based MC main prog.:  MainFOAM.cxx
    and shared library of TMCgenFOAM.cxx TRobolFOAM.cxx
 -- work directory: ./workFOKK
 -- analysis: ./Plots/PlotFoam1.cxx, exploiting results of (C)
 
   
============================= (X) ================================
!!!! Obsolete !!!! in KKMCee branch, mooved to KKMChh
Analysis chain as in Jan. 2016 to examine effects 
of switching on/off QED FSR in p p -> l+ l- (with PDFs).
Overall normalization debuged using ./Plots/PlotFSR.cxx
-- main program                ./ProdFSR.cxx
-- histogramming               ./ROBOFSR.cxx
-- work directory              ./workFSR
-- post-generation analysis    ./Plots/PlotFSR.cxx
Running instructions:
   cp workFSR/workFSR.input_E125GeV workFSR/workFSR.input
   make workFSR-start
   make workFSR-stop
   make PlotFSR

 1. automake ignores source change in *.h files in fortran code
