I shall talk on the present status of KKMC and
new options in version 4.22 with respect to older vers. 4.19 and 4.16 (CPC),
posted on  http://jadach.web.cern.ch/jadach/KKindex.html:

  - possibility of simulating quark beams, q+qbar -> l+lbar +photons, l=e,mu,tau, tau->X
  
  - q and qbar may have longitudinal mometum spread according to arbitrary PDFs, but zero kT.
  
(i) I was pointing out that QED effects fo q+qbar -> l+lbar process are the best, 
 and nobody can match its quality  without re-investing 10 man-years of work.
 
(ii) Spin effects, correlations  (needed for taus) are implemented in a full form 

  (including transverse correlations.)
(iii) Photos and Tauola are interfaced, albeit old versions are in the above code.

Next, I was trying to summarize for what KKMC can be useful in the LHC data analysis,
without major developments beyond the existing code:

- testing/calibrating Photos for FSR in leptonic decays of
  is an obvious thing and Zbyszek Was is doing this all the time...
  
- studies/estimations of ISR-FSR interferences in q+qbar->Z/->l+lbar data

- Electroweak+QCD corrections in the overall normalization for Z production.

- Spin correlations in Z->tau+tau, already done by Zbyszek

- what else???? Any new ideas????

The discussion has concentrated mainly on the above points, however,
I have also very briefly indicated in which directions one could improve
QCD correction for the incoming beams.

In this case the upper level of KKMC would be replaced by C++ code,
which is already in place in some simple form.

The extension to q+qbar->W->l+nu is thinkable, but would require
update of the QED matrix element (EW corrs. seems to be ok)

NB. W exchange for t-channel is already there and could be exploited.
I have also mentioned work done by Bennie Ward and Scott Yost.

The bottom line in the discussion was:\\
Let us exploit the existing KKMC as much as we can for LHC
and any new idea in this direction is welcome!!!

I would suggest to use version number wherever possible, a
nd more citations to related papers should be added.
First citation [16] of the KKMC version published in CPC is OK,
but quoting more precisely "KKMC version 4.13" would be better.
Moreover, the cited paper [16] in CPC contains technical description of KKMC 4.13 only,
and all physics content of KKMC v.4.13, more relevant for the discussion here,
is described in Phys. Rev. D63 (2001) 113009, so it should also be cited.

"(Although these corrections were implemented in a private version
of the program used in [20].)"
This is correct, but the description of the NNLO corrections to KKMC matrix element
relevant for THIS paper is in fact the other paper published
in parallel to ref. [20], hence:

The paper S.A. Yost et.al. Acta Phys.Polon. B36 (2005) 2379-2386 should be cited along with [20]
Moreover, NNLO corrections in [20] and inthis paper are shown in numerical form only,
The complete "algebraic" description of the NNLO formulas has been
published later on, in Phys.Rev. D73 (2006) 073001, so I recommend to cite it also.
(an extension of the previous work in Phys.Rev. D65 (2002) 073030 --
citation of this paper is my suggestion only, not recommendation.).
Unfortunately KKMC with complete NNLO corrections is not yet public.
Nevertheless the above related works would be helpful for the reader.

"Furthermore, the present version of the program is restricted to leptonic final states
and thus cannot serve for the analysis of the multitude of hadronic states mentioned above"
is not very precise. It is better to say:
"the above version 4.13 of the KKMC program...".
However, even this statement is still not precise,
because the restriction to leptonic states is only true for KKMC version 4.13
More precisely, in the unpublished (but public) version 4.16 of KKMC, posted since 2002 on
http://jadach.web.cern.ch/jadach/KKindex.html
implements a multitude of the final multipion resonances and nonresonant background,
albeit with not so very high quality of the decay simulation,
and with the QED ISR matrix element limited to NLO.
My suggestion is to mention this version 4.16 of KKMC at this point,
for instance in the footnote or in the literature.
