{\bf\color{blue}
The aim of the following study is to check \KK MC 
for quark channels at LEP2. In particular:\\
(a) check agreement with semianalytical \KK sem, \\
(b) check differences with the KORALZ 4.02 and 4.04,\\
(c) compare runs with WTed events and WT=1 events,\\
(d) check the inclusive mode in \KK MC,\\
(e) provide a benchmark for the users of \KK MC.

\vspace{2mm}
Note that both \KK MC and KORALZ are run with vvmax=0.99 input parameter.\\
FSR is switched off.\\
No attempt to tune electroweak DIZET library --
the default EW setting of KORAZ and \KK MC is used.
