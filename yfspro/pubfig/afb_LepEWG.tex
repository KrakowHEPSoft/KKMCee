      ISR*FSR and cut-off dependence at 189GeV }}

  All results for quark pairs at 189GeV.
  First table contains differences
  {\bf\color{blue} (i-j)/j} for $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ and
  {\bf\color{blue} (i-j)} for $A_{FB}$ as a function of {\em\color{red} the same} angular cut.
  Second table illustrates for each acceptance {\color{blue} (i)}
  separately the effect of the angular cut.
  Again relative change for $\sigma_{\rm tot}$ and absolute for $A_{FB}$.
  Acceptances {\bf\color{blue} (i)} as on: \\
