QUESTIONS:
{\bf\color{blue}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    How big is ISR*FSR Interference in $\sigma_{tot}$ and $A_{FB}$?
  \item
    Do we know it at \Order{\alpha^1}?
  \item
    Do we know it beyond \Order{\alpha^1}?
  \item
    How sensitive it is to cut-off changes?
  \item
    Conclusions

\begin{Slide}{{\bf\color{red} Conclusions }}

\vspace{-2mm}
{\bf\color{blue}
  \KK\ Monte Carlo and KORALZ answers on ISR*FSR Interference:\\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    For typical exp. energy cut 0.3 ISR*FSR int. is about 1.5\% in $\sigma_{tot}$ and $A_{FB}$.
  \item
    For energy cut 0.1 it is twice bigger.
  \item
    The cut $|\cos\theta<0.9$ makes it 25\% smaller.
  \item
    The \Order{\alpha^1} ISR*FSR int. is under total controll using KORALZ and \KK\ Monte Carlo
    for arbitrary cuts.
  \item
    Effects beyond \Order{\alpha^1} are negligible, ($<$20\% of \Order{\alpha^1}),
    except when energy cut is stronger than 0.1.
  \item
    ISR*FSR int. at Z radiative return is very small, as expected.
  \item
    Change from $s'$ to $Q^2$-propagator in energy cut has no effect.
  \end{itemize}
