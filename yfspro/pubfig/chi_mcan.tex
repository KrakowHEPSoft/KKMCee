  The ``Z radiative return'' (ZRR) contains as much x-section as Born!\\

{\scriptsize
Within EEX, omitting IFI and \Order{\alpha^2L},
we may quantify {\em physical precision} very conservatively using EEX2$-$EEX1:
\fbox{{\Color{Red} 0.2\%}, {\Color{Blue} 1.5\%} and {\Color{PineGreen} 5\%}}
for the
{\Color{Red}   Born-like  $(M_Z\!+\!\Gamma_Z\!<\!\sqrt{s'}\!<\!\sqrt{s})$},
{\Color{Blue}  Z radiative return    $(10GeV\!<\!\sqrt{s'}\!<\!\sqrt{s})$} and\\
{\Color{PineGreen} total            $(2m_\mu\!<\!\sqrt{s'}\!<\!\sqrt{s})$}
cross section.

Closer to reality is probably:
(EEX2$-$EEX1)/2=
\fbox{{\Color{Red} 0.20\%}, {\Color{Blue} 0.7\%} and {\Color{PineGreen} 3\%}}
Third order LL, see fig. (b) is below these estimates.

{\tiny\Color{Magenta} 
Does not apply to calculations NOT using EEX/YFS exponent.!!!}
