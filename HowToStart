HOW TO START:

If you are under Linux then proceed as below immediately.
On other instalation change f77 options according to InstalationNotes.
Manual is published in Comp. Phys. Commun. 130 (2000) 260.


MANDATORY Update/creation of makefile's everywhere, compilation flags etc.
to make FFLAGS, F77, AR evwrywhere the same as in ffbench/KKMakefile
  cd ./ffbench
  alias make='make -f KKMakefile'
  make makflag
  make makprod

BASIC DEMO:
Inclusive, mu+tau+u+d+c+s+b, hadronization on, wt=1 events,
as for the detector simulation  (20min, Pentium III 500MHz)::
	cd  ./ffbench
	cp demo/demo.input.1k demo/demo.input
	make demo-start
	diff -b demo/demo.output.1k demo/demo.output | less

OTHER DEMOS:
Inclusive, mu+tau+u+d+c+s+b, hadronization off, tau decays off, wt=1 events (19min)::
	cp Inclusive/Inclusive.input.1k Inclusive/Inclusive.input
	make Inclusive-start
	diff -b Inclusive/pro.output.1k Inclusive/pro.output | less

Tau's, decays on, beam polarization on (8min)::
	cp Tau/Tau.input.200ev Tau/Tau.input
	make Tau-start
	diff -b Tau/pro.output.200ev Tau/pro.output | less

Muons only, v<0.99, wt=1 events (5min)::
	cp Mu/Mu.input,100ev,0.99vmax Mu/Mu.input
	make Mu-start
	diff -b Mu/pro.output,100ev,0.99vmax Mu/pro.output | less

Beamstrahlung at 500GeV, (21min.)
  cp Beast/Foam500,200ev.input Beast/Beast.input
	make Beast-start
	diff -b Beast/Foam500,200ev.output Beast/pro.output | less

Low energy resonances for gamma*, with proper experimental R (4min)
Reguires CERNLIB, PAWLIB!
	cp demo_R/demo_R_15GeV_100k.input demo_R/demo_R.input
	make demo_R-start
	diff -b demo_R/demo_R_15GeV_100k.output demo_R/demo.output  | less

etc. etc.........
