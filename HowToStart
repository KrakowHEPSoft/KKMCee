HOW TO START, compile and run basic demo's:

If you are under Linux then proceed as below immediately.

All subdirectories include interrelated  custom KKMakefile's.
In case an adjustment of the fortran options is needed, 
then it is done only in the master makefile ffbench/KKMakefile.
It is then MANDATORY to update KKMakefile's everywhere:
  cd ./ffbench
  alias kmake='make -f KKMakefile'
  kmake makflag
  kmake makprod

Alternatively system of Makefile.am is also in place
and one may use autotools to create/update Makefile's everywhere.

User Manual is published in Comp. Phys. Commun. 130 (2000) 260.

BASIC DEMO:
Inclusive, mu+tau+u+d+c+s+b, hadronization on, wt=1 events,
as for the detector simulation  (20min, Pentium III 500MHz)::
	cd  ./ffbench
	cp demo/demo.input.1k demo/demo.input
	kmake demo-start
	diff -b demo/demo.output.1k demo/demo.output | less

OTHER DEMOS:
Inclusive, mu+tau+u+d+c+s+b, hadronization off, tau decays off, wt=1 events (19min)::
	cp Inclusive/Inclusive.input.1k Inclusive/Inclusive.input
	kmake Inclusive-start
	diff -b Inclusive/pro.output.1k Inclusive/pro.output | less

Tau's, decays on, beam polarization on:
	cp Tau/Tau.input.200ev Tau/Tau.input
	kmake Tau-start
	diff -b Tau/pro.output.200ev Tau/pro.output | less

Muons only, v<0.99, wt=1 events:
	cp Mu/Mu.input,100ev,0.99vmax Mu/Mu.input
	kmake Mu-start
	diff -b Mu/pro.output,100ev,0.99vmax Mu/pro.output | less

Beamstrahlung at 500GeV:
  cp Beast/Foam500,200ev.input Beast/Beast.input
	kmake Beast-start
	diff -b Beast/Foam500,200ev.output Beast/pro.output | less

etc. etc.........
