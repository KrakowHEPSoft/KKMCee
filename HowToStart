HOW TO START (compiling and running basic demo's)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparatory steps
=================
  git clone git@github.com:KrakowHEPSoft/KKMCee-dev.git
  mv KKMCee-dev KKMCee-dev-master
  cd KKMCee-dev-master

Mandatory link the latest Dizet version:
      ln -s dizet-6.45 dizet      
Please note that we recommend version 6.45, 
however two older versions for experienced users are provided.
Switching to another version of Dizet requires 
re-linking the dizet\ directory
and rebuilding the project from the scratch.

Building the project
====================
     autoreconf -i --force
     ./configure CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 -g -O2" 
        --with-hepmc=/opt/hepmc3-install
        --with-photos=/opt/PHOTOS-install
     make
     
Locations of the external \hepmc3 and \photospp\ libraries must be provided
explicitly in the configure parameters.

Running a simple example
========================
Compile and run MainMini.exe:
    cd ProdRun/workMini/
    cp workMini.input_105GeV_Leptons workMini.input
    make start
The user will be prompted to provide the number of events 
to be generated and the execution will start.
The output file pro.output contains the MC result for 
the total cross section and the multitude of statistics 
results on the MC generation process.
There are more input data for other similar control runs.

Advanced user program examples and benchmarks
=============================================
Running KKMCee in the folder ProdRun/work1/ is very simple:
      cd ProdRun/work1/
      cp work1_189GeV.input work1.input
      make start
Note that no. of events to be generated is defined in Start.C
but the execution can be stopped any time by means of
      make stop
One may also initiate MC runs in ProdRun/workTau, ProdRun/workNU 
and ProdRun/workFoam using predefined input files there.
Benchmark programs analyzing MC results from stored archive 
files can be initiated as follows:
      cd ProdDigest
      make Plot1
      make TabIIIPRD 
      make PlotNU
      make PlotTau
      make PlotBES
Archive histogram files can be replaced in the source code 
by files from the actual run. For instance one may uncomment
in Plot1.cxx input data file ProdRun/work1/histo.root
or ProdRun/workTau/histo.root file in PlotTau.cxx

Example of preparing/running 24 batch jobs on the PC farm
=========================================================
Higher statistics MC runs one may organize on linux PC farm,
for example using predefined makefiles and scripts:
    cd ProdRun/work1
    make SLfarm24
    make SLsubmitall
    make q-nev
    make q-sem
    make farm-stop
    make combine
