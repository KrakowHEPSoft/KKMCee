Ponizej log roznych uwag na temat tego projektu KKMC
ktory tutaj jest w calosci, razem z kartotekami nie-publicznymi:
UWAGA!!! KK-all to absolutnie nie jest wersja CPC ani publiczna!!!

Kartoteka z mojego dysku (S.J), ktora sie zywiolowo zmieniala gdzies
do roku 2002go a potem jeszcze troche do 2005go.
Zostala odswiezona pod linux-em SLC5 w czerwcu 2012.

Testing quark beam option took some time.
Main problem was inefficient mapping in Vesko1 for weak bremsstrahlung
(small beam charge or small energy).
Value of m_fleps protrcting from large exponent cannot be made smaller.
One has to tune alpha parameter in BornV_ReBin1 to be exactly as
in the the distribution BornV_MakeRho, that is gami and not gamiCR.
The corrected papameters in BornV_ReBin1 are:
      DOUBLE PRECISION  FUNCTION BornV_RhoVesko1(R)
      ...
      CALL BornV_ReBin1(R,gami,beta,m_vvmax,m_vv,RJac)
The same correction is done for beamstrahlung.
After that perfect agreement between KKMC and KKsem for quark
beams is obtained (20M events test are done)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
May. 21th, 2013
More changes in QED3 in order to implement properly beam charge:
      SUBROUTINE QED3_Make
      ...
      chaini = BornV_GetCharge(KFbeam)
      chain2 = chaini**2
      ...
      gami = chain2* 2d0/m_alfinv/pi*(dlog(svar/amel**2)  -1d0)
      CALL QED3_bvirt0(m_alfinv,chain2,svar , amel,deli1,deli2,deli3)
etc.
(in GPS it seems to be properly done)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Coorections which take care of proper propagation of the beam
identificator KF and proper setting of the beam mass:
      SUBROUTINE BornV_MakeGami(CMSene,gamiCR,gami)
      ...
      KFbeam = m_KFini      ! from the input
      ...
      SUBROUTINE KarLud_Initialize(xpar_input,XCrude)
      ...
      KFbeam = xpar_input( 400)   ! KFcode of beam, POSITIVE!!!
      ...
      SUBROUTINE HepEvt_Fill
      ...
      CALL  KK2f_GetKFini(KFbeam)
      amel =BornV_GetMass(KFbeam)
      ip=1                      !(&&&
      CALL HepEvt_Fil1(ip,3, KFbeam, 0,0,0,0, pf1,amel,.FALSE.)
      ip=2
      CALL HepEvt_Fil1(ip,3,-KFbeam, 0,0,0,0, pf2,amel,.FALSE.)
      ...
      SUBROUTINE QED3_Make
      ...
      CALL  KK2f_GetKFini(KFbeam)

For the initial beam setting in the input data like that
**     Beam flavour code
  400             13      KFini = xpar(400) muon beam !!!
proper event record is obtained in the output file.
Still to be checked that beam KF and mass properly propagates
all over many types the matrix element, in the MC weight.
(Charge and isospin of the beam fermion is further ahead.)

From now on this KKMC-all is the MAIN branch of the KKMC project!!!
It is KKMC version 2.20, in svn repository version 239
*******************************************************************
The other project svn repository /home/theory/svnroot/camtoph/KKMC
( C++ exercises) is from now on obsolete,
except of ffdoan subdirectory there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
May. 16th, 2013
System of Autotools is setup, see configure.in and Makefile.am files.
This is done in all directiories except YRprod.
The above allows to use kdevelop (under KDE 3.x).
Open in kdevelop from main menu Projects->New project,
and choose project type "fortran automake based".
Next in the Project Options -> Configure Options for fortran,
set compiler= gfortran,
and compiler options (FFLAGS) set as usual:
-O -g -fno-second-underscore -fno-automatic -ffixed-line-length-132 -fbackslash
kdevelop will remember the above settings in ProjectName.kdevelop file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
May. 16th, 2013
System of custom makefiles is renamed, makefile->KKMmakefile,
hence "make -f KKMakefile" should be used in the commad line,
or define and use the following alias:
    alias kmake='make -f KKMakefile'
This is done in order to isolate custom makefile system from
automake. kdevelop etc. All aternative makefile system may
be used now in parallel, no problem.

Plots in PRD63 (2000) were done mainly by pubfig/chi-mcan.f
using data from runs in E189, mix200... see also pubfig/chi-prepare.f
Failed attempt to recreated Fig.14 from PRD63 (why???):
       cp mix200/mix200_flat.input mix200/mix200.input
       make mix200-start   make mix200-stop

yfspro/pubfig/chi-mcan.f using data from runs in E189, mix200... 
see also pubfig/chi-prepare.f
(only one plot in fig.14 there comes from profig)

Directory YRprod aggregates programs and data, which were used
to produce material (plots and tables) for CERN Yellow report 2000.

In yfspro/profig:
README file helps. Pricipal "make figbet-pubs" activated,

W KK-all sa dodatkowe kartoteki ktore nigdy nie byly
jednoznacznie publiczne, albo wogole publiczne:
np: Rhadr, 2brems, MaMar, NuProd, YRprod, yfstb, yfspro

Dokladniej, to prawdopodobnie niektore z tych podkartotek
byly byc moze udostepniane zaufanym doswiadczalnikom,
np NuProd Zbyszek udostepnial a ja Rhadr.
Czyli stniala tez taka "szara strefa".
NB. Bennie i Yost chyba nie mieli calego KK-all, ale nie
jestem pewien, byc moze zostawilem im jakas wersje na
lokalnym komputerze na UTK w roku 2000.

Publiczna wersj (CPC etc) zawsze byla tworzona przy pomocy
"make export" i zawiarala podzbior kartotek, z grubsza polowe.

Bottom line: KK-all nie nadaje sie wprost do dystrybucji,
nawet prywatnie, bez jakichs dodatkowych ustalen.

Uruchomilem wszystkie testy z pliku "HowToStart"
i zakomitowalem drobne poprawki w mekefile'ach.

------------------------------------------------------------------
feb. 5th 2013

The entire KK-all is put into svn repository at IFJ-PAN

                Email to coauhors May 14th 2012
                ===============================

Hi Bennie and Scott,
Below are remarks on the beam type change in KKMC.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beam particle fermion type is set in .KK2f_defaults in main directory of KKMC
 400             11      KFini = xpar(400) dont change it                |<<<<|
with the indication "dont change it".

Then in the matrix element, for instance in BornV_Dizet,
beam ID is used like that:
        amin  = m_amferm(ABS(KFi))
        IVini = IV(KFi)
        CALL BornV_givizo( IVini, 1,aizor,qe,kdumm)
in order to define beam mass and couplings.
Beam type is preset before in BornV_Initialize(xpar_input), of course
     m_KFini = xpar_input( 400)        ! KFcode of beam, POSITIVE!!!
It looks that Born xsection in BornV_Dizet includes properly
beam charge and isospin.
So it should work for initial quarks at least at Born level!
EW corrections are implemented through formfactors,
so they may work for initial quarks beams, at least approximately.
This should be checked, some EXTERNAL benchmarks to compare with, are needed!

Beam charge for ISR is used in KarLud_YFSini, which gets data from BornV:
        CALL BornV_GetAvMult(AvMult)
This AvMult and other ISR variables in BornV depend centrally on m_alfpi
     m_AlfInv = xpar_input(30)         ! Alpha_QED at Thomson limit
     m_alfpi  = 1d0/m_pi/m_AlfInv
It looks that alfpi should not include beam charge,
and the only place where beam charge is missing for the purpose of ISR
is in BornV_MakeGami:
     KFbeam = 11           ! KF=11 is electron
     amel   = m_amferm(KFbeam)
     ...
     gami    = 2d0*m_alfpi *( DLOG((1+beta)**2/am2) -1d0)
     gamiCR  = 2d0*m_alfpi *  DLOG((1+beta)**2/am2)
Note that electron ID=11 is also exceptionally hardwired here!
It looks that it is the only place in ISR, where beam charge is missing
and electron identity is hardwired!

Concerning beam mass,
it seems that it is implemented properly everywhere,
like for instance in BornV:
        amin  = m_amferm(ABS(KFi))
It would be relatively simple to test whether non-electron beam mass is handled properly:
one should take tau's as initial beam and check one of many internal semi-analytical
cross-checks in KKMC. No external benchamrk is needed!
My guess from looking into code is that this will work without any corrections.

Below are things for which I need another round of code axamination:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The real problem is not with beam mass definition,
but in the fact that it comes as a ratio amel/Ene,
if Ene is changing due to ADDITIONAL energy
loss like beamsstrahlung of initial PDFs,
BEYOND what is handled by KarLud_YFSini!
For the ISR alone reweighting may work?
I have to look into that...

Another related problem with EXTRA variation of Ene is the change
of the position of Z peak in MZ/Ene.
(Due to memorization of the photon spectrum by Vesko/Foam)
If this change is less then Z wodth the reweighting may work,
otherwise I have to look more closely into my beamstrahlung
implementation, into what is there done or missing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: ISR*Beamstr. generation in KKMC

Dear Scott,
I have looked into KKMC and below is what I see.
Best regards, staszek

***************
The Initialization of ISR is managed by
KarLud_Initialize (in KK2f/Karlud.f)
In case of beamstrahlung KarLud_Initialize calls BStra_Initialize (of
bornv/CStra.f)

Inside BStra_Initialize 3 instances of Foam are initilized, they
generate distribution of dimensionality 1,2,3 provided by
BornV_RhoFoamA, BornV_RhoFoamB, BornV_RhoFoamC located in bornv/BornF.f.

In the end of the initialization each of 3 Foam's provides an estimate
of the (crude) cross section, which is fed into special tool MBrB
managing 3 branches (Foams) in the MC.

The 3-fold split of the ISR*Beamstrahlung distribution is due to
complidated parametrization of the beamstrahlung distribution and
probably not needed for QCD PDFs.

Lets examine FoamC with BornV_RhoFoamC distribution:
Inside BornV_RhoFoamC the 3-dim. distribution is defined in
      Rho = Rho *SF12
      BornV_RhoFoamC = Rho*BornV_Crude(m_vv)/(1d0-m_vv) in lines
429-432 of BornV.f
SF12(z1,z2) is 2dimensional beanstr. distrib. defined above, while Rho
insludes also jacobian due to simple mapping done below line ELSEIF(
Option .EQ. 2 ),  while Born crude xsection BornV_Crude(vv) collects
distributions from various final state flavours, QCD overall corrections
etc.
(The contributions from various flavours KF are recorded in MBrA object
for the purpose of KF generation) NB. BornV_Crude uses
BornV_Differential, which exploits BornV_Simple, lowest order Born used
at this stage.

***************
The Generation of ISR is done by KarLud_Make (in KK2f/Karlud.f) which
invokes BStra_Make (of bornv/CStra.f), which calls:
CALL FoamC_MakeEvent(BornV_RhoFoamC).
Again BornV_RhoFoamC calculates/generates 3-dim. distribution in z1, z2
of beamstrahlung and z=1-v of QED ISR.

The choice between FoamA,B,C is done randonmy by
      CALL MBrB_GenKF(Itype, Wt_KF)
in BStra_Make according to probabilites predefind in the initialization
(see above).
NB. MBrB module also manages maximum weight<1 for the final rejection in
case we want WT=1 events.
The above 3-fold branching is prbably not necessary for QCD PDFs, only
one branch (FoamcC ???) should be preserved.

***************
The final MC weight is calculated after FSR is generated
         CALL KarFin_Make(xxf,amfi1,amfi2,charg2,wt_FSR)
in KK2f.f, for example in the following call
         CALL GPS_Make                   !<-- CEEX    interfer. ON
