Dear Staszek,
sorry for the late answer but I was trying to produce some new result
before disturbing you again.
Let me firstly answer to your question: we define the missing
momentum in a "photon independent" way:
	->      ->     ->    ->
	p     = p    - p   - p
	 miss    Phi    pi+   pi-

in fact we impromperly use the term theta_gamma to indicate the angle
'theta_gamma'=180-theta_pi+pi-  
where theta_pi+pi- is the angle respect to the beams of the total momentum
of the two pions. This is usually easily understood by the people not
involved in the measurement but is misleading in the case of more
photons: infact it's always a missing momentum angle and only sometimes a
photon angle.

About FSR
---------
I tried to check the FSR to understand if the simultaneous production of
ISR and FSR photons in the same event changes dramatically what we have
seen with EVA generator (from Kuehn et al.) that was producing only ISR
or FSR in the same event. As you suggested the low Q^2 region could be
enhanced because of the rho peak: 
		    ISR      FSR
		Phi---->rho ----> pipi threshold 

To check this I used the cuts of our 'large photon angle' analysis:

 40<theta_pi <140      60<'theta_gamma'<120 degrees

that allow to reach the pipi threshold region kinematically forbidden for
the small angle analysis.

Also with this cuts the cross section given by KKMC is in good agreement
with the one obtained by PHOKHARA without vacuum polarization: 

	  2.75 +-0.02	(KKMC)  
	  2.725+-0.008  (PHOKHARA)

Setting the RRes card:
 13              2 
I got the FSR shown in the plots. The normalization is fixed using the
KKMC cross section without FSR (2.75 nb) and using the result from EVA
generator from Kuhn et al. (3.27 nb) in case of FSR. This is just a trial
since EVA is giving only O(alpha) + collinear radiation for the ISR.
Nonetheless the plots do not show a dramatic contribute of FSR at low Q^2
beyond the 20% predicted by EVA. I need to generate more statistics to say
something more precise.

About VACUUM POLARIZATION
-------------------------
I tried to check the vacuum polarization in PHOKHARA and it is very
simple. The correction applied to the cross section is of the kind:

inte = inte/(1.d0-vacuumpolarization(qq))

where 

vacuumpolarization = deltalep(qq,me) + deltalep(qq,mmu)
     &  + deltalep(qq,mtau)

and deltalep is the function:
      double precision function deltalep(qq,ml)
      include 'phokhara.inc'
      double precision qq,ml,bet,ml2,rat

      ml2 = 4.d0*ml**2
      rat = ml2/qq

      if(qq.gt.ml2)then
         bet = sqrt(1.d0-rat)
         deltalep = alpha/(3.d0*pi)*(1.d0/3.d0-(1.d0+ml2/2.d0)
     &            *(2.d0+bet*log((1.d0-bet)/(1.d0+bet))))
      elseif(qq.ge.0.d0)then
         bet = sqrt(rat-1.d0)
         deltalep = alpha/(3.d0*pi)*(1.d0/3.d0-(1.d0+ml2/2.d0)
     &            *(2.d0-bet*atan(1.d0/bet)))
      else
         write(6,*)'deltalep:qq<0 not supported'
         stop
      endif
      end
      
It was not so easy for me to understand the function XFOTF3 in dizet
library but I guess it's much more complicate because it's designed for
a more general use.

About RADIATION FUNCTION
------------------------
Finally I would like to see what happens if I set the pion from factor to
1 (FPI=1 in RRes_formkuehn02(s,FPI) ). In the case of PHOKHARA we get the
radiation function, is this true also for KKMC? 

Thanks for your attention. I wish you a nice time at SLAC, best regards,

						Stefano
