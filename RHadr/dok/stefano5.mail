Dear Professor,
I performed the first comparisons of the MC quantities we need in our
analysis. The results are quite good:

Cross section:
-------------
We require:
- missing energy: Emiss > 10 MeV
- missing momentum angle: 'theta_gamma' <15 or 'theta_gamma'>165 degrees
- pions angle : 40<theta_pi<140 degrees (for both pions)

Sigma(KKMC,no vacuum polarization)     = 23.85 +- 0.05 nb 
Sigma(Phokhara,no vacuum polarization) = 24.06 +- 0.03 nb

			discrepancy  0.9 +- 0.2 %

In fact we use Phokhara with vacuum polarization:
Sigma(Phokhara, vacuum polarization)   = 24.34 +- 0.02 nb
but I was not able to get a similar cross section with KKMC (switching on
the flag KeyELW in the card the cross section came out exagerately low)


Acceptance
----------
The efficiency for the cut 
pions angle : 40<theta_pi<140 degrees (for both pions) 

is

eff(KKMC)    = 80.5 +- 0.2 %
eff(Phokhara)= 80.42+- 0.04%

     in perfect agreement

Track mass cut
--------------
The track mass Mtrk is defined by:

 0 = (E_phi-sqrt(Mtrk^2+|p_pi+|^2)-sqrt(Mtrk^2+|p_pi-|^2)+
     -|p_phi-p_pi+-p_pi-|^2

The cut adopted is
 
	220>Mtrk>120 and

	(M_pp^2/0.85)^2 + ((Mtrk-250)/105)^2 > 1

The cut is sensitive to the radiative tails, the efficiencies are:

eff(KKMC)    = 94.7 +-0.1 %
eff(Phokhara)= 94.52+-0.02%

	again in perfect agreement!


I downloaded successfully the new version of KKMC from your web site.
Please let me know if you have some hints on the use of vacuum
polarization.
I also would like to test the final state radiation: is it enough to
switch on the flag KeyFSR.
Thanks a lot, 

				Stefano Di Falco
