Dear Staszek,
I also observed that the hadronic VP was missing and in fact it's not
present in PHOKHARA in any other part of the program. Federico Nguyen has
inserted it recently using a function from Fred Jegerlehner used in
BABAYAGA but in the version of PHOKHARA we used to get the radiation
function (and then the pion form factor) there was only the leptonic VP.
The pion form factor Graziano gave you is very preliminary, just a
qualitative (and nice) check with the CMD2 results, he considered the VP 
a problem to be dealed with in a second iteration when also the
experimental systematics will be better under control.
If the vacuum  polarization must be included in the radiation function or
in the pion form factor is still not so clear for me, I probably need to
discuss more with Axel.

Concerning the agreement KKMC vs KKMC I send you the plots from which I
got the number: unweighted.ps comes from 30 million of e+e- at the Phi,
what I call sigma_tot comes from 
grep -i pb demo.output
The error I quote is only the statistical fluctuation on the number of
events.
I also generated 120 million of weigthed events and the cross section is
closer to the one you give me. But I don't know how to quote the error on
sigma. What I call sigma_norm comes from 
grep -i crude demo.output
I remember you told me to look at the dispersion of the weight
distribution but the distribution seems to strange for me..

For what I read from your logbook (there's I thinksome misprinting on
TrigNew=0  and on the costheta cut , should be cos(15 degrees)= 0.966)
we are using the same kinematic cuts.

Thank you for your nice counterchecks, best regards,

							Stefano
