Subject: VP, rho formfactor, example ASCII file...

Dear Achim,
In the attachment there is example ASCII for the histogram,
obviously each line represents: lower edge of the beam, 
normalized distribution and its absolute error.

Still one thing: could you provide both Born and NLO versions?
At some point we should check how do we treat vacuum polarization
and which rho formfactor do we use.
If you have some prefered rho formfactor, then the best is to send me
relevant subroutine, I shall plug it into KKMC.
Before we do these adjustment it does not make much sense to run
high statistics jobs.

Best regards, Staszek
